# Hw 1

```
./hw1_rnn.sh $1 $2
./hw1_cnn.sh $1 $2
./hw1_best.sh $1 $2
$1: the data directory, $2: output filename
```

### P.S.
* The best model score will be slightly different because I choose a faster prediction method.
* All model stores in `model/`.<br>
* Best model needs to wget first! (in hw1_best.sh script)
